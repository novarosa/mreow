## game (?)

to start, this repo will mostly be adapted from the [TwinkleBearDev SDL2
tutorial](https://www.willusher.io/sdl2%20tutorials), with the main
modifications being adapting it to C and make from C++ and cmake, as
well as just generally adapting it to a workflow im more
comfortable/familiar with.
